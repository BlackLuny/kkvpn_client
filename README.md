kkvpn_client - kkVPN client application
=======================================

kkVPN is a lightweight tunneling application, that allows encrypting transmission over Internet. 
It creates a virtual local network between the nodes, securing the data flow with AES256 cipher
and authenticating users with DSA schema.

Uses the kkVPN network driver, which allows it to work at the transport layer, making it
transparent for network applications running on the computer. Requires little to no 
configuration to operate - connection is set up using generated connection strings, making
setup easy and quick.

A BSc Thesis - temporarily written in Polish. Will be translated to English, once BSc has been obtained :)
